![AO3 graph](./ao3_distribution.svg)

A python program to generate a graph showing the work distribution of AO3 and a power function approximating it. Thank you to ![ao3_api](https://github.com/ArmindoFlores/ao3_api) for saving me from having to learn web scraping.

Uses the ![GLWT license](https://github.com/me-shaon/GLWTPL) because I bashed this out in around an hour and is therefore probably awful code.
